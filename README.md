# Cryptographic Algorithms

Proposed list of cryptographic algorithms (with their attributes) to be used as input for Export Control Classification.

This list is based on the list of algorithms detected by [Minr](https://github.com/scanoss/minr "Minr")

The current list of algorithms is maintained in the [algorithms.md](algorithms.md) file.
